\title{Get Intersection Point of Two Lines}
\usage{
get_intersection(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A named vector with intercept ["a"] and slope ["b"].}

\item{y}{A named vector with intercept ["a"] and slope ["b"].}
}
\value{
A named vector giving the intersection, \code{\link{NULL}} if the
lines do not intersect,  \code{\link{NaN}} if they are identical.
}
\description{
Get the intersection point of two straight lines given in slopeâ€“intercept
form.
}
\examples{
get_intersection(x = c(a = 0, b = 1), y = c(a = 2, b = -1))
get_intersection(x = c(a = 0, b = 1), y = c(a = 2, b = 1))
x <- c(a = 0, b = 1)
get_intersection(x = x, y = x)
