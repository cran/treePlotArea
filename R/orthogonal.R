#' Get the Slopeâ€“intercept Form of an Orthogonal
#'
#' If slope-point form of an equation is given, we might be interested in the
#' slope-intercept form of the orthogonal to the equation running through the
#' point.
#' @param b The slope.
#' @param xy The point.
#' @return A named vector with intercept ["a"] and slope ["b"], as in
#' \code{\link[graphics:abline]{graphics::abline}}.
#' If the slope was 0, there is no slope-intercept form as this is a vertical
#' line. Then the intercept is \code{\link{NA}} and the slope gives the value of
#' x.
